Financial inclusion is the provision of affordably priced banking infrastructure to huge segments of the marginalized and low-income classes. It is an indispensable economic element not only of the economies of the developing nations but also of advanced ones. 

Access to banks is a huge indicator of financial inclusion. Commercial banks allow individuals and business to not only save and make payments efficiently but also build up their credit worthiness (through borrowing and repaying accordingly) which can improve their access to financial instruments and services. In Kenya, uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda only 13.9% of the adult population have or use bank accounts. This implies that a majority of the population does not have access to a lot of financial services which can greatly impact their financial outcomes. Therefore, being able to predict which individuals are most likely to have a bank accounts will allow for an efficient way to reach those whose are cut off from the financial ecosystem.

The aim of this analysis is to come up with a model that can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account.


# Business objectives:

- Build a classification model that a person has a bank account or not using identified demographic factors.
- Determine the most important variable that can help predict whether an individual has a bank account or not.
